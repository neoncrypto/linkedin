# Understanding Basic Data Structures

For beginner and intermediate programmers, mastering basic data structures is a crucial step in building a solid foundation in programming. Data structures are the building blocks of efficient code, helping you organize and manage data effectively. This article will explore some fundamental data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees. Weâ€™ll discuss their uses, advantages, and how to implement them in Python.

## Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest and most commonly used data structures. They store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access and manipulation.

### Uses:

    - Storing collections of data such as numbers, strings, or objects.
    - Efficient indexing and iteration over elements.

### Advantages:

    - Fast access to elements using indices.
    - Easy to traverse and manipulate.

### Example in Python:
<!-- data_struct_py_1.png -->
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 3
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Linked Lists

A linked list consists of nodes, each containing a data element and a reference to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation.

### Uses:

    -Implementing stacks and queues.
    -Dynamic memory allocation where array resizing is inefficient.

### Advantages:

    -Dynamic size, easy to insert and delete elements.
    -Efficient memory usage for large data sets with frequent insertions and deletions.

### Example in Python:
<!-- data_struct_py_article_2.png -->

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node

ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
```
<br>

## Stacks

A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

### Uses:

    -Implementing function calls and recursion.
    -Undo mechanisms in text editors.

### Advantages:

    -Simple to implement.
    -Efficient for managing function calls and temporary data storage.

### Example in Python:
<!-- data_struct_py_article_3.png -->
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack)  # Output: [1, 2]
```

## Queues

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Uses:

    -Managing tasks in a print spooler.
    -Handling requests in web servers.

### Advantages:

    -Simple to implement.
    -Efficient for managing ordered tasks.

### Example in Python:
<!-- data_struct_py_article_4.png -->
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: 1
print(queue)  # Output: deque([2, 3])
```

## Hash Tables

Hash tables store key-value pairs and provide fast data retrieval based on keys. They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.

### Uses:

    -Implementing associative arrays or dictionaries.
    -Efficiently storing and retrieving data based on keys.

### Advantages:

    -Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
    -Efficient memory usage for large datasets.

### Example in Python:
<!-- data_struct_py_article_5.png -->
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

hash_table = {}
hash_table["apple"] = 1
hash_table["banana"] = 2
print(hash_table["apple"])  # Output: 1
print(hash_table)  # Output: {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2}
```

<br>

## Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to its children. The most common type is the binary tree, where each node has at most two children.

### Uses:

    -Representing hierarchical data like file systems.
    -Efficient searching, sorting, and hierarchical data management.

### Advantages:

    -Fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.
    -Efficiently manage sorted data.

### Example in Python:
<!-- *data_struct_py_article_5.png -->
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
```
